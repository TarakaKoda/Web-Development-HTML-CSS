    <p>I love to learn <em>HTML</em></p>
    <!-- em is used to indicate text that should be emphasized when it is displayed by default the styling of the em element is italic but we can customize it with css-->

    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor <i>sit</i> amet.</p>
    <!-- similarly we can use the i element to make the text italic, but this is not the best practice we only do styling in the css -->

    <p>learning new things give me <strong>happiness</strong></p>
    <!-- strong element is used to display the text strong in the browser by default it will be in bold bu we can change whatever we want -->
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit <b>amet</b>.</p>
    <!-- similarly we have b element to make the text bold, and you guessed it we shouldn't use that -->
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <!-- h1 heading 1 represents the most important heading -->
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <!-- h5 heading 5 represents the least important heading -->
    <!-- there is a common mistake on the different developer that the choose the headings based on their size which is very wrong we can always resize the headings using css. -->

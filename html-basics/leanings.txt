-> What is HTML Boilerplate Template?
   An HTML Boilerplate Template is often refer as HTML Boilerplate ie., a basic starting point for creating HTML documents.
   It is template that includes the essential structure and commonly used elements required for a typical web page.

-> A typical HTML boilerplate includes the following key components:
1. <!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration specifies that the document is an HTML5 document.

2. <html>: The root element that encloses the entire HTML document.

3. <head>: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, character encoding, and links to external resources like stylesheets and JavaScript files.

4. <meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies the character encoding for the document (UTF-8 is commonly used for encoding text in multiple languages).

5. <title>: Sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.

6. <link>: Links to external resources like stylesheets (CSS files) to define the document's presentation.

7. <script>: Links to or embeds JavaScript code for enhancing interactivity and functionality.

8. <body>: Contains the content of the web page that users see and interact with, including text, images, and other media.

-> What is meta element?
   In HTML, the <meta> element is used to provide metadata about the HTML document. Metadata is information about the document that is not displayed on the web page 
   but is used by browsers and search engines for various purposes. The <meta> element is typically placed within the <head> section of an HTML document and does not have a closing tag.

-> What is a Character set?
   Computers don't understand the Character like a, b, c,...so we use character set to map the character value to the binary numbers that the computer can understand.
   they are only under the numeric value (binary numbers) so we use the character set to map the characters to the binary value so that the computer can understand
    1. ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
          But this is only limited to the english characters only 

    2. UTF-8: This UTF-8 can represent almost all the element in the world. so we use this character set more often.

->  The <p> element is used to represent the paragraph of text.
 
-> The <em> element in HTML is used to indicate text that should be emphasized when it's displayed by a web browser. Emphasized text is typically displayed in italics by default, 
   although the specific styling may vary depending on the browser and the CSS applied to the document.

-> The <strong> element is used to indicate text that should be given strong importance or emphasis. When a web browser renders text enclosed within the <strong> element, 
   it typically displays it in a bold font by default. However, the visual appearance of text within a <strong> element can vary based on the CSS styles applied to your HTML document.

-> Heading elements are used to define headings or title for a section of the web page.
   heading provide structure and hierarchy to your content,  helping both human and search engine to read our web pages properly.
   HTML offers six heading elements, from <h1> to <h6>, with <h1> representing the highest level of importance and <h6> the lowest.

-> Entities are special codes or sequences that are used to represent characters or symbols that have a special meaning or might not be easily typed on a keyboard. 
   HTML entities are often used to ensure that specific characters are displayed correctly in web pages, regardless of the character encoding used.

-> Numeric Entity: &#code; (where code is a decimal or hexadecimal value representing the character's Unicode code point).
-> Named Entity: &name; (where name is the name of the character or symbol).
  
-> Here are some commonly used HTML entities:
   Named Entities for Special Characters:
   1. &amp; for the ampersand character &.
   2. &lt; for the less-than sign <.
   3. &gt; for the greater-than sign >.
   4. &quot; for double quotation marks ".
   5. &apos; or &lsquo; for single quotation marks '.
   
   Numeric Entities:
   1. &#169; for the copyright symbol ©.
   2. &#174; for the registered trademark symbol ®.
   3. &#8364; for the Euro currency symbol €.
   4. &#9829; for the heart symbol ♥.
   
   Special Characters:
   1. &nbsp; for a non-breaking space.
   2. &ndash; for an en dash –.
   3. &mdash; for an em dash —.
   4. &copy; for the copyright symbol ©.

-> HyperLinks: Hyperlinks are used to create clickable elements that allow users to navigate to different web pages or resources on the internet. Hyperlinks are created using the <a> (anchor) element, 
               and they are a fundamental part of web navigation.

-> Difference between Link and Hyperlink
   Link: A link is just a address that is pre populated address
   Hyperlink: A Hyperlink is a clickable button with which we can click and navigate to that address

-> Images: <img> using the img element we can render the images in the web pages.
           And by using the css we can customize the style of the images

-> Video: <video> using the video element we can display the video in the browser
          controls: we can give access to the controls to the video
          autoplay: this is a boolean, by enabling this the video will automatically starts playing
          loop: with this the video will be in a loop 

-> Audio: <audio> element will works same as the video element. controls, autoplay, loop and all.

-> Lists: In HTML,  we have 3 types of lists but most of the time we use the under order list <ul>
         we use this <ul> when the order doesn't matter.
         On contrast we have order list <ol> this is a order list, the order of this list matters 
         we have another type of list called description list <dl> inside that list we can have a description term <dt>
         inside that term we can have the description detail.

-> Tables: you can create tables to display tabular data using the <table> element and a combination of related elements to define the structure and content of the table. Here's how to create tables in HTML:
         Table Element (<table>): The <table> element is the container for your table.
         Table Row (<tr>): Inside the <table> element, you define rows using the <tr> element.          
         Table Header Cell (<th>): Within a <tr>, you can use the <th> element to define header cells. Header cells are typically used to label columns or rows. They are bold and centered by default.
         Table Data Cell (<td>): Inside a <tr>, you use the <td> element to define data cells. Data cells contain the actual data or content of the table.
         Table Caption (<caption>): You can include an optional <caption> element immediately after the opening <table> tag to provide a title or description for the table.
         we can also use the the <thead>, <tbody>, <tfooter> to make the search engine can efficiently read the web page.

-> containers: In HTML we have different types of containers, one of the most often used container is called <div> division element
               <div> element is a block level element, these elements are always starts in new line and fill the entire block
               we have another generic container named <span> unlike the div this is a inline container.
               <div> and <span> is a general purposes containers.
               in HTML5 we and other containers too.

-> semantic containers: In HTML5 we have more descriptive and meaningful we refer to this as semantic containers
                        <article>, <figure>, <mark>, <time>.
                        These are used by the search engines to search more accurately.

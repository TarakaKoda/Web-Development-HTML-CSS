IMAGES: 
1. Image types and formats
2. background Images
3. CSS Sprites
4. Data URLs
5. Clippings Images
6. Applying filters
7. Supporting high-density screens
8. Resolution switching
9. Using modern images formats (WebP)
10. Art direction
11. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
12. Icon fonts

-> Images types and formats: In computer we have two types of images
                             1. Raster: we use raster images for photos. 
                             2. Vector: we use vector for icons and backgrounds.

   1. Raster: -> Come from cameras/scanners
              -> Formats: JPG(Joint Photographic Experts Group), PNG(Portable Network Graphics), GIF(Graphics Interchange Format)
              -> More Pixel = Larger file size
              -> Look blurry if scaled up

   2. Vector: -> we can create vector adobe illustrator 
              -> Created in software (illustrator)
              -> Format: SVG
              -> Scalable Vector Graphics
              -> Look sharp at any size

Raster images formats:

                Colors       Transparency        Animation
JPEG             16M             No                 No
GIF              256             Yes                Yes
PNG              16M             Yes                Yes
WebP             16M             Yes                Yes

-> In HTML we have two types of images: 
   1. Content Images
   2. background Images

-> Content Images: Content images are images that are an integral part of the page's content. 
                   They are usually displayed within the HTML document and are typically surrounded by text or other content. 
                   Content images are included using the <img> element in HTML.

-> background Images: Background images, as the name suggests, are used as a background for a specific element or the entire web page. 
                      They are set using CSS properties like background-image. Background images don't appear as standalone elements in the HTML structure but rather serve as a visual backdrop.

-> CSS Sprite: This is a optimizing technique used with the images ie., if we have a multiple images used in the webpage. if we reload that page then the browser will send multiple requests to the server
               for each image to load this is time time consuming we can optimize this using the css sprites. Its is a technique to combine the all the images and make it into a single image 
               so that if we refers the page the browser will send only a single request.
               But, this comes with the problems ie.,
               1. the file size can get too Larger
               2. sprite are not flexible.

-> Data URLs or formerly called Data URIs: This is another optimization technique to reduce the http requests.
   using this technique we can directly embedded the images to the head section of the html file.

-> Clipping:
